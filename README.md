In this full-stack project, we're building and deploying an AI Text Summarizer using Next.js 15, Firebase, and Gemini AI â€” step by step.

In this project there is a concept of how to set up your project with the latest features of Next.js 15 App Router, build dynamic routes, connect to Firebase Firestore, and integrate Googleâ€™s Gemini AI to summarize text. Weâ€™ll also add authentication, a user history page, copy-to-clipboard, delete functionality, and finally deploy it live with Vercel.

ðŸ“¦ Project Features:
âœ” Google login with Firebase Auth
âœ” Secure summary generation using Gemini AI
âœ” Save and fetch summaries per user
âœ” Mobile-friendly UI with responsive tabs
âœ” History list with copy and delete actions
